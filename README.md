Shenkuu Warrior II Game Conversion to Unity:
While training on various aspects of 2D game development in Unity, I started this project to 
convert one of Neopets games to Unity.
The physics of the warrior flight and the controls are at a good level of development.
My next step is to translate the complex and powerful level generating system from AS3 to C# and apply it
to the Unity version.
Stay tuned for more development.
